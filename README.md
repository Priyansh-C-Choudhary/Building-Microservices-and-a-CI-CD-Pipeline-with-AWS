# Building-Microservices-and-a-CI-CD-Pipeline-with-AWS
AWS Academy Lab Project - Microservices and CI/CD Pipeline Builder [92187]

In this project, we are challenged to use at least 11 AWS offerings, including some that might be new to you, to build a microservices and continuous integration and continuous development (CI/CD) solution. 

By the end of this project, we will be able to do the following:

1. Recognize how a Node.js web application is coded and deployed to run and connect to a relational database where the application data is stored.
2. Create an AWS Cloud9 integrated development environment (IDE) and a code repository (repo) in which to store the application code.
3. Split the functionality of a monolithic application into separate containerized microservices.
4. Use a container registry to store and version control containerized microservice Docker images.
5. Create code repositories to store microservice source code and CI/CD deployment assets.
6. Create a serverless cluster to fulfill cost optimization and scalability solution requirements.
7. Configure an Application Load Balancer and multiple target groups to route traffic between microservices.
8. Create a code pipeline to deploy microservices containers to a blue/green cluster deployment.
9. Use the code pipeline and code repository for CI/CD by iterating on the application design.
